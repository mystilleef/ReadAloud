# Directory Overview

This directory contains a collection of saved web pages from the official Chrome for Developers documentation. These files serve as offline reading material for learning and referencing various aspects of Chrome extension development.

## Key Files

The directory includes the following tutorials and guides:

*   **hello-world:** A beginner's guide to creating a basic "Hello World" Chrome extension. It covers the fundamental concepts and the basic structure of an extension.
*   **popup-tabs-manager:** A tutorial on how to create a popup that manages browser tabs. This is useful for extensions that need to interact with and organize the user's open tabs.

*   **debug:** This file likely contains information and instructions on how to debug Chrome extensions, a crucial skill for any extension developer.

## Usage

The files in this directory are intended to be used as a local, offline reference for developers who are building Chrome extensions. They can be opened in a web browser to read the documentation and follow the tutorials.

To start learning, it is recommended to begin with the `hello-world` file and then proceed to the other files based on the specific features you want to implement in your extension.
